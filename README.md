# spreadLabels
Finds coordinates for labels on a scatter plot without overlap.

# TODO:
- turn into package?
- install/run example code that can be copy-pasted
- some example plot for show.
- add open license.

disclaimer: This is very sloppy code atm, just thrown together. Very as-is. Feel free to change anything or whatever.
